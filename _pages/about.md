Undergraduate Student, <br>

I am an RIT Undergraduate Student, a veteran currently serving in the NY Army National Guard, a current NASA intern, and an aspiring researcher. I have done multiple personal projects on topics I am interested in such as robotics, computer vision, autonomous systems, and machine learning. I plan to pursue research in these fields, and will soon be applying to postgraduate programs.

While only a freshman in high school, I was selected to attend a local Early College High School Career Academy program. In this, I participated in college classes on a college campus whilst also being in high school, staying in the top 10 of my graduating class as well as earning CompTIA A+ and CCENT certifications during that time. 

After Graduating high school, I began attending Rochester Institute of Technology as a computing exploration major. During my first two semesters I realized that I could not afford to go to college and did not have help to cosign student loans. This was a very stressful time and my grades were dropping. I thought I would have to give up on college education until I learned about military benefits for college students. I have joined the Army National Guard as an Intelligence Analyst to help afford college and to serve my country. Before I finished Basic and Advanced training, I found out that I would deployed for the duration of 2020. I had enough time for one semester of classes before then. I declared my major as computer science and worked hard to succeed. During my deployment I was attached to a special operations group being placed in a position much higher than my title due to my leadership and skill set. During my deployment I aided in relief efforts to victims of the Port of Beirut blast, learning how important drones can be to help people. I also continued to pursue college remotely via satellite.

As I approach the end of my Bachelor's degree, I have managed to raise my GPA from a 2.71 after my first year up to a 3.53, making the Dean's list every semester since then. My last semester I branched out my studies, taking 6 courses which included an independent study and a masters level electrical engineering course on machine learning and robotics. Doing so helped reinforce my passion for the subject and my goals to pursue postgraduate education.

For the future, I plan to pursue postgraduate studies in robotics. I have found a passion in doing research as an undergraduate and want to extend that to the next level. I want to contribute to the collective knowledge in the field and see breakthroughs come to fruition in physical implementations!

My unique experiences have also allowed me to travel the world on personal trips and I have been able to go to Japan for 1 month, and the U.S. Virgin Islands where I became a PADI certified scuba diver. I have found a love for exploring new frontiers, which I hope to combine with machine learning one day in space or ocean oriented robotics research.

If I could choose one word to describe myself, it would be tenacity. I may get knocked down, but I always get back up and continue to put one foot in front of the other on my path in life.

Undergraduate Student, <br>
[Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu), New York

I am an RIT Undergraduate Student, a VA disabled combat veteran currently serving in the NY Army National Guard, and an aspiring researcher. I have gone through many hardships to get to where I am today, but I strive to succeed, and dream in the stars. I have done multiple personal projects on topics I am interested in such as machine learning, autonomous systems, and computer vision. I hope to pursue research in these fields and develop novel findings.

While only a freshmen in high school, I was selected to attend a local Early College High School Career Academy program. In this, I participated in college classes on a college campus whilst also being in high school. Those classes were networking and network security focused and I have maintained an outstanding average of 3.9 and above while staying top 10 in my high school. I have completed certifications Including CompTIA A+ and the CCENT as well during that time. 

After Graduating high school, I attended Rochester Institute of Technology. During my first two semesters I realized that I could not afford to go to college and did not have help to cosign student loans. This was a very stressful time and my grades were dropping. I thought I would have to give up on college education until I learned about military benefits for college students. I have joined the Army National Guard as an Intelligence Analyst to help afford college and to serve my country. Before I finished Basic and Advanced training, I found out that I would be deployed for the duration of 2020. During this deployment I was attached to a special operations group being placed in a position much higher than my title due to my leadership and skill set. During my deployment I aided in relief efforts to victims of the Port of Beirut blast, learning how important drones can be to help people. I also continued to pursue college, getting A's in Linear Algebra and Database management classes remotely from RIT.

Coming back from the military gave me a sense of responsibility and a hardened resolve. I sacrificed a lot to be able to pursue my goals and if I want to apply to a competitive postgraduate position, I must overcome the baselines. Since my return, I have made dean's list every semester since never falling below a 3.8 semester GPA since. I have earned A's in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Multi-variable Calculus courses. Doing so, I have managed to take a 2.71 GPA and raise it to over a 3.4 overall, with a 3.59 in my core major classes.

My unique experiences have also allowed me to travel the world on personal trips and I have been able to go to Japan for 1 month, and the U.S. Virgin Islands where I became a PADI certified scuba diver. I have found a love for exploring new frontiers, which I hope to combine with Machine Learning research one day in space, or ocean oriented robotics research.

If I could choose one word to describe myself, it would be Tenacity. I may get knocked down, but I always get right back up and keep putting one foot in front of the other.

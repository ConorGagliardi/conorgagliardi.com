I am an RIT Undergraduate Student, a veteran currently serving in the NY Army National Guard, and an aspiring researcher. I really love working with new technologies and learning new things! Lately I have been learning a bunch about autonomy in robotics. I have done multiple personal projects on topics I am interested in such as machine learning, autonomous systems, and computer vision. I plan to pursue research in these fields, and will soon be applying to postgraduate programs.

While only a freshmen in high school, I was selected to attend a local Early College High School Career Academy program. In this, I participated in college classes on a college campus whilst also being in high school, staying in the top 10 of my graduating class as well as earning CompTIA A+ and CCENT certifications during that time. 

After Graduating high school, I attended Rochester Institute of Technology. During my first two semesters I realized that I could not afford to go to college and did not have help to cosign student loans. This was a very stressful time and my grades were dropping. I thought I would have to give up on college education until I learned about military benefits for college students. I have joined the Army National Guard as an Intelligence Analyst to help afford college and to serve my country. Before I finished Basic and Advanced training, I found out that I would deployed for the duration of 2020. During this deployment I was attached to a special operations group being placed in a position much higher than my title due to my leadership and skill set. During my deployment I aided in relief efforts to victims of the Port of Beirut blast, learning how important drones can be to help people. I also continued to pursue college remotely via satellite.

As I approach the end of my bachelor's degree, I have managed to raise my GPA from a 2.71 after my first year up to a 3.53, making the Dean's list every semester. My last semester I branched out, taking 6 courses which included an independent study, and a masters level electrical engineering course on machine learning and robotics, which helped reinforce my passion for the subject and my goals to pursue postgraduate education.

My unique experiences have also allowed me to travel the world on personal trips and I have been able to go to Japan for 1 month, and the U.S. Virgin Islands where I became a PADI certified scuba diver. I have found a love for exploring new frontiers, which I hope to combine with Machine Learning research one day in space or ocean oriented robotics research.

If I could choose one word to describe myself, it would be Tenacity. I may get knocked down, but I always get right back up and keep putting one foot in front of the other towards my goals.

- [Autonomous Micro UAV System (Personal Project)](https://github.com/ConorGagliardi/)<br>
Personal project turned into an independent study course at RIT. The plan is to research and design an experiment for 
software implementation for a drone to be able to perform a mission (autonomous mapping), and during the mission, 
return to a recharging station (wireless contact charger). Testing will use a simulated environment for training, and final 
experimenting will be done using physical drone system. As the project is expanded on, I will post updates during this
semester. This is my biggest project yet, so I will include detailed videos and research analysis.

- [Experiment adding SMOTE to CNN Net Traffic Identifier (Machine Learning Project)](https://conorgagliardi.com/projects/smoteproject)<br>
Link to research paper and github link. An experiment adding SMOTE to code with publication: Pytorch implementation 
of deep packet: a novel approach for encrypted traffic classification using deep learning.

- [Fashion MNIST Classifier using Tensorflow Convolutional Neural Network (Machine Learning
Project)](https://conorgagliardi.com/fashionMNISTproject)<br>
Link to research paper. Project to implement and experiment with CNN hyperparameters. Classify Fashion MNIST dataset as a bonus, as well as MNIST digit set.

- [MNIST Classifier using Support Vector Machines and Random Forest Classifiers (Machine
Learning Project)](https://conorgagliardi/SVMRFproject)<br>
Link to writeup. Project to implement an SVM and Random Forest to classify the MNIST digit set.

- [OpenCV Motion Detector / Object Tracking (Personal Project)](https://github.com/ConorGagliardi/OpenCVPractice)<br>
Experimentation using OpenCV in order to draw bounding boxes around detected motion from linked livestreams or videos

- [Tic-Tac-Toe Adversary A.I. (Artificial Intelligence Course Project)](https://github.com/ConorGagliardi/TicTacToe-Adversary-AI)<br>
Created an adversary A.I. using LISP. Uses heuristic minimax search with a depth of 2.

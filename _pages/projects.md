- [Autonomous Micro UAV System (Personal Project)](https://github.com/ConorGagliardi/)<br>
Personal project turned into an independent study course at RIT. The plan is to research and design an experiment for 
software implementation for a drone to be able to perform amission (autonomous mapping), and during the mission, 
return to a recharging station (wireless contact charger).

- [Experiment adding SMOTE to CNN Net Traffic Identifier (Machine Learning Project)](https://conorgagliardi.com/SMOTEproject/)<br>
Link to research paper and github link. An experiment adding SMOTE to code with publication: Pytorch implementation 
of deep packet: a novel approach for encrypted traffic classification using deep learning.

- [Fashion MNIST Classifier using Tensorflow Convolutional Neural Network (Machine Learning
Project)](https://conorgagliardi.com/fashionMNISTproject/)<br>
Link to writeup and github link. Project to implement a CNN to classify Fashion MNIST dataset as well as MNIST digit set.

- [MNIST Classifier using Support Vector Machines and Random Forest Classifiers (Machine
Learning Project)](https://conorgagliardi/SVMRFproject)<br>
Link to writeup and github link. Project to implement an SVM and Random Forest to classify the MNIST digit set.

- [OpenCV Motion Detector / Object Tracking (Personal Project)](https://github.com/ConorGagliardi/OpenCVPractice)<br>
Experimentation using OpenCV in order to draw bounding boxes around detected motion from linked livestreams or videos

- [Tic-Tac-Toe Adversary A.I. (Artificial Intelligence Course Project)](https://github.com/ConorGagliardi/TicTacToe-Adversary-AI)<br>
Created an adversary A.I. using LISP. Uses heuristic minimax search with a depth of 2.

**Current work:**

- Researching monocular vision based drone formation and control. Some tasks I am working towards are using CNN based object detection for drone recognition, closed-loop functionality without external communication for localization, single command oriented formation change.

**Research Interests:** 
Autonomous Systems, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Robotics, Aerospace / UAS software, Cybernetics and BioRobotics

My research works and projects include:

- Independent Study on small-scale Autonomous UAV system, using ORB-SLAM with ROS.
- Research and Development of EMG-controlled UAV system using machine learning for feature extraction of EMG signals.
- Various projects using OpenCV for motion detection, principle component analysis, and object detection.
- Extensive research as an intelligence analyst in the National Guard during my deployment, including work for the Port of Beirut blast in 2020 using UAV systems that aided international investigators to determine the cause of the blast and provide relief to thousands of affected Lebanese citizens.

**Upcoming Work:**
- Soon to begin research in next internship for Spring2024 on point cloud registration, 3d features, hazard detection, in order to facilitate safe-site identification, and terrain relative navigation for spacecraft and landers.

**Current Work:**

- See the projects page to view current and previous research.
- I am currently working on researching an autonomous rover system at NASA for collaboration with augmented reality spacesuits.

**Research Interests:** 
Robotics, Autonomous Systems, Computer Vision, Aerospace / UAS software, Cybernetics and BioRobotics / Biotechnology, Deep Learning

My research works and projects include:

- Monocular vision based drone formation and control. YOLOv8 based object detection for drone recognition, closed-loop functionality without external communication for localization, single command oriented formation change.
- Independent Study on small-scale Autonomous UAV system, using ORB-SLAM with ROS.
- Research and Development of EMG-controlled UAV system using machine learning for feature extraction of EMG signals.
- Various projects using OpenCV for motion detection, principle component analysis, and object detection.
- Extensive research as an intelligence analyst in the National Guard during my deployment, including work for the Port of Beirut blast in 2020 using UAV systems that aided international investigators to determine the cause of the blast and provide relief to thousands of affected Lebanese citizens.

**Research Interests**: 
Autonomous Systems, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Robotics, Aerospace / UAS software, Cybernetics and BioRobotics

My research works and projects include:

- Independent Study on small-scale Autonomous UAV system.
- Research and Development of EMG-controlled UAV/AUV system.
- Experimentation and development with OpenCV
- Extensive research as an intelligence analyst in the National Guard during my deployment, including work for the Port of Beirut blast in 2020 utilizing UAV systems 
that aided international investigators to determine the cause of the blast and provide relief to thousands of affected Lebanese citizens.

**Current work:**

- Continuing research on Autonomous UAV system, with uninformed mapping and pathfinding as well as mid-mission recharging.
- Developing machine learning model to extract features from EMG data to direct drone movements in simulation.
